## Description
Projects from the New York City Data Science Academy

- Developed a recommender system for beer that utilized both content-based and collaborative filtering algorithms. Implemented an ensemble of the SVD++ algorithm (incorporating both explicit and implicit ratings) and the Restricted Boltzmann Machine algorithm, plus an NLP algorithm consists of TF-IDF and LSI on the user reviews
- Scored in the top 9% in the Allstate Claims Severity Kaggle competition using a stacked model of multiple gradient boosting trees and feedforward neural networks
- Scraped television show data from three different websites and analyzed significant differences between each scoring system using statistical techniques such as PCA and ANOVA
- Built a prediction and visualization application for the popular mobile game Pokémon Go using R and Shiny; implemented a k-NN algorithm to help players predict the rarity of the Pokémon at any location
- Conducted exploratory visualization on the New York City restaurant safety inspection data
